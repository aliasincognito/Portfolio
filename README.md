# Portfolio
Portfolio for my Data Science projects. 
This repository contains some sample projects, showcasing my competencies in data analytics and machine learning. In general, I've picked topic areas that I'm passionate about, and that I hope will pique your interest. Thanks for taking a look!

The most recent, and I believe most representative sample of my work can be found in the "NHL Skater Model Fantasy Points" project!
